\ This research explores convolutional neural network (CNN)-based semantic segmentation methods specifically tailored for the detection of colorectal polyps in colonoscopy images. The study systematically examines multiple critical elements influencing CNN performance, including comparative analyses of various model architectures, training methodologies, data augmentation strategies, and the selection of loss functions. Through extensive experimental evaluation, the work assesses how each factor individually and jointly impacts segmentation accuracy, model robustness, and generalization to previously unseen data. The primary objective is the identification and validation of an advanced CNN model capable of surpassing current state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Such improvements have the potential to significantly enhance early colorectal cancer detection and clinical decision-making during colonoscopy.
